						<b> Iranian Wedding Ceremony </b><br> <br> There are two stages in a typical wedding ritual in Iran.
						Usually both phases take place in one day. The first stage is known as "Aghd",
						which is basically the legal component of marriage in Iran. In this process,
						the Bride and Groom as well as their respective guardians sign a marriage contract.
						This phase usually takes place in the bride's home. After this legal process is over,
						the second phase, "Jashn-e Aroosi" takes place. In this step, which is basically the
						wedding reception, where actual feasts and celebrations are held, typically lasts from about 3–7 days.
						The ceremony takes place in a decorated room with flowers and a beautifully decorated spread on the floor.

						<b>Persian dance </b><br><br>

						Persian dance or Iranian dance refers to the dance styles indigenous to Iran.
						Genres of dance in Iran vary depending on the area, culture, and language of the local people,
						and can range from sophisticated reconstructions of refined court dances to energetic folk dances.
						The population of Iran includes many ethnicities, such as Kurds, Azerbaijanis, Turkmen, Jews,
						Armenian, Georgian peoples, in addition to numerous Iranian tribal groups which can be found
						within the borders of modern-day Iran.Each group, region, and historical epoch has
						specific dance styles associated with it.Raghs (also spelled as Raqs) is the Arabic
						word for dance, and is almost exclusively the word used for dance in Persian,
						as the Persian word for dance, paykubi, is no longer in common usage.
						It's also the word in Azerbaijani for dance (Reqs). The Kurdish word for dance is Halperke,
						and the Lurs from Lorestan use the word Bākhten (or Bāzee) for dance.The earliest
						researched Persian dance is a dance worshiping Mithra (as in the Cult of Mithras)
						in which a bull was sacrificed. This cult later became highly adhered in the Roman Empire.
						This dance was to promote vigor in life

						<br><br><b>Persian Carpet</b><br><br>

						Iranians were some of the first people in history to weave carpets.
						As time progressed, the complexity and beauty of rugs
						increased to a point where rugs are now bought as decorative pieces.Because of the long history of fine
						silk and wool rug weaving in Iran, Persian rugs are world-renowned as some of the most
						beautiful, intricately designed rugs available.
